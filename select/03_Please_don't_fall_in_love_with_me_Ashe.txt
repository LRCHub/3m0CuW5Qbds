Please don't fall in love with me
I'll give you almost everything
I'll melt myself to fit your mold
And carefully chip away my soul
Until there's nothing left to see
Oh, please don't fall in love with me
I'm unprepared and under siege
My house is soaked in gasoline
And you're the matchstick on the wall
One strike to go and burn it all
The flames will dance in jubilee
Oh, please don't fall in love with me
I'll tell you all my secret fears
To weaponize against me, dear
I'll show you every inch of skin
And take you where you've never been
I'm just a girl with paper hands
And playing tough's my fatal scam
You'll learn your wish is my command
You're Alice in my Wonderland
I can't keep up this fantasy
Oh, please don't fall in love
Please don't fall for me, don't fall for
(My slippery little tongue, you're getting strung along)
Please take back your gifts and flowers
(I can't reciprocate, you know they die anyways, uh)
Please stop calling me your hero
(I can't save myself, how do I even help out a somebody else? Ah)
Please don't fall for me, don't fall for me
We'll become a family
And slowly lose our sanity
I'll kiss you with my poisoned lips
And crash our ship into a cliff
A mythical Greek tragedy
Oh, please don't fall in love with me
