I was wondering, maybe
Could I make you my baby?
If we do the unthinkable
Would it make us look crazy?
If you ask me, I'm ready
If you ask me, I'm ready,
I'm ready
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm rea—
Did you already know him?
It's coincidental
That he learns your body
and mind the way I do
The secrets you told me,
were they confidential
Or do you let anyone
inside your mental?
I bet you ain't told him
the things that we been through
I know you're not flashin'
your wrist like you been doin'
The fact that I actually
started to trust you
Then you broke my heart,
somеone bring me a tissue
Or maybе my notebook,
I'll sharpen my pencil
To write you a letter
and show you I'm into you
(Show it)
Still down forever,
even if it's pleasure
Go 'head,
sign your name
on the package I sent to you
(Open)
Open it up and
when you get to cheesin'
I hope that you believe
in the end that I got you
(Got you)
How can I move forward
when every relationship
I get in,
don't hit the same
if it ain't you?
So please don't fall
in love with me
Don't fall in love with me
Don't fall in love with me
Don't fall in love with me
So please don't fall
in love with me
(Don't fall)
Don't fall in love with me
(Don't fall)
Don't fall in love with me
(Don't fall, don't fall)
Don't fall in love with me
Do you still use that Versace
bag that I bought you?
Look back at the pics
of vacations I brought you on?
He can't even match it,
he's not in my bracket
You settle for less with him,
with me, I put you on
It doesn't look good on you,
way too appealin'
To go through experiences
that he's been givin' you
'Cause you see on this side,
I'll drape you in fire
Got bundles of roses
lined up to the ceiling
I'm so good without you,
I know that I'm healin'
(Healin')
But that doesn't change
that the way I've been feelin'
(Feelin')
Is clouding my judgment,
I act like it's nothin'
(Nothin')
But really I'm sufferin',
I'm way too forgivin'
(Sufferin')
I saw your new man
and he looks like a joke
It's been a while since
the both of us spoke
I can't help but think
that my life would be better
If we never met,
but that's not how it goes
So please don't fall
in love with me
(You can't fall for me)
Don't fall in love with me
(You can't fall for me)
Don't fall in love with me
(Do not fall)
Don't fall in love with me
(Fall)
So please don't fall
in love with me
(Don't fall)
Don't fall in love with me
(Don't fall)
Don't fall in love with me
(Don't fall, don't fall)
Don't fall in love with me
